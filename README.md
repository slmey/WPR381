# Knee Down – Community Portal for Motorcycle Racers

## Project Overview

**Knee Down** is a dynamic community web application created for motorcycle racers and enthusiasts. The platform showcases racing-relevant events, team details, and a way for users to connect with the community. It’s designed to build a central space where racers can stay updated, engaged, and connected.

This project was developed as part of the WPR37(8)1 group assignment. The site features dynamic EJS rendering, modular Express.js routing, a styled UI with CSS, and a functional contact form with in-memory data handling.
